Reciprocal Cycles
-----------------
A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:

1/2 = 0.5
1/3 = 0.(3)
1/4 = 0.25
1/5 = 0.2
1/6 = 0.1(6)
1/7 = 0.(142857)
1/8 = 0.125
1/9 = 0.(1)
1/10 = 0.1

<Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.
Find the value of d < 1000 for which 1/d contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.

Possible approaches:
- Implement long division in code, keeping track of running remainders, and watch for repeated remainder.  Number of steps to repeated remainder is period.
- Let machine compute decimal representation, and then look for repeated decimal in the result
-- standard float is only good to 53 places of precision - and that only for smaller numbers - will need to use something other than float
--- consider using arbitrary precision floats, and set precision to be very long (can we automatically determine a good precision from limit?)
--- consider using rationals (either implemented by hand or built in type)
-- Regardless of implementation, then extract digits by successively multiplying number by 10 and extracting the units portion.  Keep list of digits until we
see a repetend.
