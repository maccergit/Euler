# Euler
Eclipse projects for Project Euler

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems. See http://projecteuler.net for more info.

I am using Python to explore these problems, partly because Python has built-in support for large numbers (thousands of digits) and because it has a rich numerical library. This repo contains the Eclipse pydev projects for my exploration of Project Euler.
