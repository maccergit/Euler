Smallest multiple

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

Solved by inspection - 2520 is LCM of 1..10, so just need to multiply by primes missing from 11..20 - 2 is needed because 16 is 2^4, and 2520 only contains 2^3.
