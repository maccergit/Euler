Lattice paths
-------------

Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?
----------
- the size of the grid in the problem is the number of squares - but the number of intersections is (n + 1) x (n + 1)
- a simpler grid of a single square has 2 paths - include as a test case in addition of the problem statement
- 2d array can be list of lists, or NumPy array (but NumPy arrays tend to be faster only when doing vector operations).

Recursive divide and conquer:
- if intersection is bottom, right edges : end recursion
- if intersection is bottom edge : paths = paths from intersection to right
- if intersection is right edge :paths = paths from intersection to bottom
- paths = paths from intersection to right + paths from intersection to bottom
final answer is paths from root intersection
